# Git - Quick and Dirty #

A presentation of Git for beginners and glossary for git related stuff online, with much help of all the git presentations from Scott Chacon and a focus on subversion users.

This is using the showoff gem for presentation. Start the presentation via:

    sh> gem install showoff
    sh> git clone <this repository>
    sh> cd git-qnd
    sh> showoff serve
